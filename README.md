### Installation

Application requires [Express](https://expressjs.com/) v4+ and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) v5 to run.

Backend installation

```sh
clone respository or download files
create .env file in root folder
add in .env file:
ATLAS_URL= xxxx mongo atlas url xxxx
NODE_ENV=development
SESS_NAME=xxxx session name xxxx
SESS_SECRET=xxxx session secret xxxx
ROLE_ADMIN=Admin
ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN=Super Admin
HOST_EMAIL=xxxx smtp host email xxxx
PORT_PROVIDER_EMAIL=xxxx port provider email xxxx
EMAIL_USER= xxxx shop email, from where is send confirmation xxxx
PASSWORD_USER= xxxx password generated by your email provider xxxx
EMAIL_SENDTO=xxxx where should come email from clients xxxx
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY= xxxx stripe publishable key pk_test... xxxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=xxxx stripe secret key sk_test_... xxxx
npm install in root folder
```

Client installation

```sh
cd ./client
npm install in client folder
```

- In app.js file in root folder, in cors origin change to http://localhost:3000
- In package.json file in client folder, remove proxy.
- In client/src/helpers/request.js in axios.create --- add line: baseURL: "http://localhost:5000"
- In folder routes/checkout.js change this in development mode:
  success_url: `http://localhost:3000/booking/success/${bookingId}`,
  cancel_url: `http://localhost:3000/booking/cancel/${bookingId}`,
- The can appear some errors due to cookie sameSite or content security blocking after changes in browsers, so it is good to test with https protocol on localhost.
- Google map is only for development purpose here so can appear message popup.

To test in stripe, use number card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
